### Steps

    cd inno
    ```

1. Run npm install - this installs all the dependencies of the project (found in package.json) :

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Config File

There is a `config/default.json` config file that provides default value 
Add a `production.json` and `development.json` file in the `config` directory. These files are used to store API keys and various other variable configurations like : site-url, contact-form-email, etc. Only add the things you want to overwrite in `default.json`.

It needs to have the following format :

```json
{
  "mailgun": {
    "auth": {
      "api_key": "<your-mailgun-api-key>",
      "domain": "<domain-registered-on-mailgun>"
    }
  },
  "url": "<domain-name-on-which-this-is-setup>",
  "hashids": {
    "secret": "<hash-secret-for-unique-id-generation>",
    "no_chars": 4,
    "chars": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890"
  },
  "contactEmail": "<email-for-contact-form>",
  "dbhost": "<mongodb-host-url",
  "sessionSecret": "<session-secret>",
  "fb": {
    "clientID": "<FB-app-id-for-login>",
    "clientSecret": "<fb-app-secret>",
    "callbackURL": "<site-url> + /login/fb/callback"
  }
}
```

    ```sh
    npm run dev:watch
    ```

### Admin Access

To get access to admin panel, you'll have to manually mark a user as `is_admin: true` in the DB. 
You'll need [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) or other similar tool for it.
